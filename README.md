PREDICTION OF CUSTOMERS SUBSCRIBING TO TERM DEPOSITS IN A BANKING INSTITUTION
Problem Statement
•	For any business to successful, customer retention is important. With current rate of 78% being the retention rate, customer retention is much more an effective way than that of finding new customers.
•	The bank collects feedback from its existing customers, they manually collect the feedback through telephonic marketing whether the customer will subscribe to the term deposits or not and by the time the end results are predicted by machine learning model, we can easily sort out the issues that led to negative fallbacks of the policy.
